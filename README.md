### Game Rules
#### How to start?
- Make sure you installed your Argent Wallet and connect to the game
- You need to have some eth to be used as gas
- You can get some free $WORLD token (faucet function, can you figure out?)
- Then go and bidding your favourite spot for awesome BillBoard Ads

#### How to bid?
The actual bidding price starting from 1 $WORLD, and every bid the price will go double. And effectively half of the $WORLD will go to previous bidder's pocket, so you dont lose any money to be fair as long as somebody outbid you, but you do lose the BillBoard owner rights and status quo in the game. Yes, Owner rights and status quo are more important right? üòÑ

#### Generate your unique NFTs
Remember at any point of time, you can be out bid by the next person and you lose your BillBoard Ads, but before that you can generate your unique NFT to remember your glorious moment. This unique NFT will be stored in your wallet and be view on Aspect or anything StarkNet compatible NFT platforms. So damn cool!

Then you can view all your flashy NFTs in your wallet or ASPECT.
